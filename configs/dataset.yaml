# Dataset configuration for real-time graffiti vandalism detection
# YOLOv8 format - Optimized for immediate threat detection

# Dataset paths (relative to this config file or absolute)
path: ../data  # Root directory
train: train.txt  # Training images list
val: val.txt      # Validation images list
test: test.txt    # Test images list (optional)

# Number of classes
nc: 1

# Class names

  0: graffiti

# Detection priorities for real-time alerts
priority_contexts:
  - public_property    # High priority: schools, government buildings
  - transportation     # High priority: trains, buses, bridges
  - private_property   # Medium priority: businesses, residential
  - artistic          # Low priority: authorized murals
